# Artist Statement
Inspiration:
One day, I looked outside of the window, I saw a lovely dog playing a colorful ball! Dogs are easy to become happy, when they have food (bones) and people to play with them (Pingpang and boy).

Challenge:
It's hard to get the color because user need to know how close they are when they chose a color and the entities are moving very fast. Especially when they want to choose multiple colors to draw on the nine grids.

dangers/opportunities:
if touch the naughty boy, it will skip the nine grids input color game and directly show the current number
if click the middle grid, it will disappear immediately.

challenge calibrated:
it's hard to follow the pace of the red-green-blue bones but still can get the color that user want.

viewer feel:
Hope they will love the color that they and their pets chosed together. Also,hope they can spend more time to take care of their pets.
