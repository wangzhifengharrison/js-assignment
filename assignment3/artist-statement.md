# Artist Statement

Base:
My arcade game is based on space invader game.

Background and persuade:
Since space junk seriously threat astronaut and aircraft safety and the amount of space junk if larger and larger, human beings need to gather together and contribute more and less to solve this threatening. I know it’s impossible for everyone to make contribution is it because Industry specializing in surgery, I just want to bring an idea here to clarify that space junk problem should not be ignored. What’s more, my audience from all industries like Space Science, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Finance. Etc., can gather together and generate new ideas on it.

Persuasive, beautiful and fun?
In my opinion, persuasive is the core for my art, beautiful and fun may influence user experience and become interesting on my topic. 
In my arcade game, I think about my topic and get general understanding of this topic by searching on net during most of the time and finish the draft of the game by using eclipse and squares. 
Then, in the rest of the time, I tried to beautify my work and use cute rocket, satellite etc. to represent as space junk since actually, the space junk are several wreckage and it not beautiful. What’s more, I use robot as human and use hands to collect junk instead of equipment and net in order to represent it intuitively.

Audience engagement
Not only by beautiful design, I tried to engage my player by different levels to become difficulty and let them to explore higher levels.
